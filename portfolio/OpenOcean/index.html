						<h2>Open Ocean</h2>

						<p class="left"><br/>Open Ocean is a game about collecting treasure and pushing your luck.
						This game was took from Lunar Lander of Atari in 1979. We tried to find a way to iterating on it.
						Because landing in a low gravity is the core gameplay of the original game, we decided to
						switch the environment to the deep ocean, and let players to control a submarine to land, which is quite
						like landing on the lunar land. Besides, we made a more complex terrain and add some treasures to give players
						more positive feedbacks.
						</p>

						<p class="left">The first version is made by Phaser, which is a web game framework. In that
							version, I implemented gameplay logic and some necessary functions like polygon collision and
							tween animations.
						</p>

						<p class="left">To develop a mobile version, the next iteration is made by Unity. we added touch screen interaction,
							gravity interaction, and score board based on the first version.
