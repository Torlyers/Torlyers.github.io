> Terrain Builder & Random Generation

## Summary
Some sandbox game like Minecraft has a large and complex terrain. If there is a terrain system in the game, it will be very convenient to build a game environment. I like Minecraft very much, so maybe the terrain is voxel-based. I watched a tutorial in GDC this year, and I think using perlin noise to generate voxel-based terrain generation is durable in three weeks.

## Features

#### Customize voxel cubes

Allow users to design and customize voxel cubes and set generation  probability of each kind of cubes. In this way, the system is more flexible and user can adjust the resources distribution. It means there will be human-readable parameter data files.

#### Unity Style Terrain Builder

Allow users use mouse to build terrain height map. Users can use brush to "print" mountains and lakes in a plane. After building, users can export terrain files.

#### Automatically Terrain Generation

If users doesn't want to manually "print" a map, they can also choose to automatically generate terrain, and export it.
