## Summary
After build human-readable mesh files, we want to apply it into more uses. This time we build meshes in Maya and export it into our own formats. Literually, we can export whatever meshes to the game engine only if it has less than 65535 vertices, which is enough for most of the meshes that we want to render in real-time.
