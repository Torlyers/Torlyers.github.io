> Let's meet up in the new world.


Greetings,

My name is Zhitao Zhao, a game engineer & engine engineer with love in narrative and game design.

I like playing games, researching game design, enjoying stories and narratives. My favorite games are [Trails in the Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trails_in_the_Sky) series by [Falcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Falcom). I'm also a good FPS player, a reliable DPS in overwatch.

I am now working on my Master degree in Entertainment Arts and Engineering at the University of Utah and will graduate in May 2019. Currently, I am concentrating on Unreal and developing my game engine with C++ and Direct3D. My passion for coding is gameplay development. I am also enthusiastic about real-time rendering.
